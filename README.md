# DMS
Decision Making System (DMS)

This project was inspired by the akinator. It allows you to progress through a ternary tree and do "help sessions" where you come to a final answer. Currently I have one script which is for a washing machine trouble shooter; I am in the process of writing more scripts. 

(Note: Be sure to dowload the tex file and place it in the same folder as the other files if you download this project locally.)
